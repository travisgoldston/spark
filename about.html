          <h1>About us</h1>
          <p class="lead">This page is here because people like to know who they’re working with. We’re happy to share—but we keep the focus on you. Your business, your goals, and what “good” looks like for you matter most.</p>

          <h2>We’re not an agency. We’re a husband and wife who want to see small businesses succeed.</h2>
          <p>sparkSEO isn’t a big agency with layers of account managers and junior staff. It’s the two of us. We do the work ourselves—the strategy, the writing, the ads, the listings. When you work with us, you work with the people actually doing the work. No handoffs, no repeating your story to someone new.</p>
          <p>We started this because we saw too many good businesses invisible online. They were great at what they did, but when someone searched for their service, another business showed up—not because that business was better, but because they were easier to find. We wanted to help level that. We’re not here to sell you a package you don’t need. We’re here to help you get found so you can do more of what you’re already good at.</p>

        <div class="container">
          <span class="eyebrow">Why this page is about you</span>
          <h2>Your story matters more than ours.</h2>
          <p>We could fill this page with our résumés and past clients. But what actually matters is whether we can help you. So while we’re glad to share who we are, we keep the emphasis on you: your business, your goals, your definition of success. Our job is to listen, understand where you are, and then do the visibility work so more of the right people find you.</p>
          <p>If you want to know how we work, that’s on our <a href="/how-it-works">How it works</a> page. If you want to know what we do (SEO, ads, websites), that’s on our <a href="/services">Services</a> page. If you want to know what it costs and whether you’re a good fit, that’s on our <a href="/pricing">Pricing</a> page. This page is just a chance to say: we’re real people, we’re small on purpose, and we’re rooting for you.</p>

          <h2>Direct contact. Plain language. No runaround.</h2>
          <p>You’ll have our contact. You can text or call when something’s on your mind or when you just want a quick update. We don’t use a ticket system or make you wait a week for a reply. We explain what we’re doing in plain English—no jargon, no dashboards you have to learn. If something isn’t working, we’ll say so and adjust. We’d rather be honest than impressive.</p>
          <p>We’ve worked with local businesses for years—plumbers, dentists, contractors, therapists, cleaners, and more. We’ve seen what works when you’re small and when every dollar and every lead counts. We’re not trying to scale into a big agency. We’re trying to do right by the businesses we work with so they can grow in a way that fits their life.</p>

            <li><strong>Who’s behind sparkSEO?</strong> <span>A husband and wife team. We run the business and do the work ourselves.</span></li>
            <li><strong>Are you an agency?</strong> <span>No. We’re intentionally small. You work with us directly.</span></li>
            <li><strong>How long have you been doing this?</strong> <span>We’ve been helping small businesses with visibility for years. We’ve worked with dozens of local businesses across different industries.</span></li>
            <li><strong>Why “sparkSEO”?</strong> <span>We want to help spark the moment when someone finds you online and decides to call. SEO is part of that; so are ads and a clear website. The name reflects that focus.</span></li>
