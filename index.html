            <h2>You’re great at your work. But online, you’re invisible.</h2>
            <p>
              Most of your business comes from referrals. They love you. But the phone is quieter than it used to be.
              When someone searches for what you do, another business shows up. Not because they’re better&nbsp;&mdash;
              just easier to find.
            </p>
            <p>
              Maybe you tried marketing before. Money went out. Nothing clear came back. You get random calls from
              companies promising the world. You don’t know who to trust, and you don’t have time to figure it out.
            </p>
            <p>
              So you keep doing the real work, hoping it will sort itself out. Meanwhile, people who need you are
              calling someone else.

                actually do. When things are unclear, the system plays it safe and shows another business instead.

              Spark is not an agency. There’s no junior team behind the curtain. When you work with Spark, you work

            </p>
            <p>
              You have my phone number. You can text me when something feels off, when you have a question, or when you
              just want to know how things are going. No ticket system. No waiting a week for a reply.

              I learn your busy seasons, your best type of customer, and what a good month means for you. The goal

                  It depends on where we start. Cleaning up your listings and running focused ads can start bringing

                  They can, if they’re left alone. Ads work best when someone is watching them, trimming what doesn’t

                  if it’s clearly bringing real leads.
