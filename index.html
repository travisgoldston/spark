                  It depends on where we start. Cleaning up your listings and running focused ads can start bringing
                  new leads within days or weeks. Deeper search improvements can take a few months to really show up.

                  You keep what’s been built&nbsp;&mdash; your website, your listings, your content. Over time, if no
                  one maintains things, results may slowly fade. But you’re never stuck. If life changes or the work no
                  longer makes sense, we pause or stop without penalties.

                  Yes. Your website, content, and accounts are yours. I’ll help set things up in a way that you can

                  They can, if they’re left alone. Ads work best when someone is watching them, trimming what doesn’t
                  work, and focusing on what does. We’ll start with a budget you’re comfortable with and only increase
                  if it’s clearly bringing real leads.
