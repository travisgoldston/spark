          <span class="eyebrow">Pricing for local businesses</span>
          <h1>You’ll know the cost and what to expect before you commit.</h1>
          <p class="lead">We built our pricing so it makes sense for a local business. You get clarity on what you’d pay, what you’re actually buying, and whether we’re a good fit. The goal is to reduce risk and help you feel informed, not to surprise you later.</p>
        </div>

      <section class="section">
        <div class="container">
          <span class="eyebrow">How pricing works</span>
          <h2>Every business is different. Most fall into predictable ranges.</h2>
          <p class="section-intro">We don’t use one fixed price because your situation is unique. But most local businesses land somewhere in a few common bands. This page is here to help you put yourself in a realistic starting point before you ever contact us. When we talk, we’ll give you real numbers. Until then, the ranges below are a good place to start.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- SECTION 3: TYPICAL STARTING PLANS -->
      <section class="section section-dark">
        <div class="container">
          <span class="eyebrow">Typical starting points</span>
          <h2>Three common ways we start. Not contracts. Not rigid packages.</h2>
          <p class="section-intro">These are where most new clients begin. Think of them as starting points, not locked-in plans. We’ll adjust once we understand your goals.</p>

              <h3>Local Visibility Starter</h3>
              <p>For businesses that mainly need consistent calls and to show up when people search on Google Maps.</p>
              <p>We get your Google listing in shape, fix technical issues that hurt visibility, set up simple tracking so you know where leads come from, and make steady monthly improvements. You get found for what you do and where you are.</p>
              <p><strong>Typical investment: $800 to $1,100 per month</strong></p>

              <p>For businesses that want a steady flow of leads and to show up in more searches over time.</p>
              <p>We do ongoing work to improve how you rank in search, create useful content that answers what your customers look for, expand the kinds of searches you show up for, and improve how your site turns visitors into calls or form fills. Built for steady growth, not quick spikes.</p>

              <p>We build a solid SEO foundation, manage your Google Ads so you’re not guessing, and optimize your landing pages so more visitors become leads. You get both organic visibility and paid traffic working together. Ad spend is separate and you control it.</p>

      <!-- SECTION 4: WHY THIS PRICE RANGE EXISTS -->
      <section class="section">
        <div class="container">
          <span class="eyebrow">Why these numbers</span>
          <h2>Below this range usually doesn’t move the needle. Above it is often more than you need at first.</h2>
          <p>Cheaper options tend to spread effort too thin. There’s a minimum amount of real work it takes to improve how you show up in search and in Maps. Below the ranges above, that work usually doesn’t get done in a way that moves rankings. On the other side, going much higher early on is often unnecessary until you’ve seen results and want to scale. For many local businesses, a few extra good customers per month is enough for the investment to make sense. We’re happy to talk through your numbers so you can decide what’s right for you.</p>

          <h2>Who usually benefits, and who probably shouldn’t hire us yet.</h2>
          <p>We’d rather be upfront than waste your time or ours. Here’s who tends to work well with us and who might not.</p>

            <article class="panel">
              <h3>Usually a good fit</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>You’re a small or local business with one location or a defined service area.</li>
                <li>Your customers search for what you do (e.g. “plumber near me,” “dentist in [town]”).</li>
                <li>You want more calls or form fills and are willing to invest a realistic monthly budget to get there.</li>
                <li>You prefer working with a real person you can text or call, not a big agency with account managers.</li>
                <li>You’re okay with plain-English updates instead of dashboards and jargon.</li>
                <li>You’re ready to fix the basics (listing, website, or ads) and stick with it for at least a few months so we can see what works.</li>

              <h3>Probably not a fit yet</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>You need national or global reach and heavy brand campaigns. We focus on local visibility and search.</li>
                <li>You’re looking for the lowest price and aren’t as concerned about results or communication.</li>
                <li>You want a one-off project with no ongoing relationship. We’re built for ongoing visibility work.</li>
                <li>You need complex tech (e-commerce, multi-location dashboards, heavy integrations). We keep things simple.</li>
                <li>You’re not sure you can commit at least a few months. SEO and consistency take a little time; we’re honest about that.</li>

          <ol class="process-list">
            <li><strong>We review your visibility.</strong> We look at how you show up online today: your Google listing, your site, and where you’re visible (or not).</li>
            <li><strong>We send you a short video.</strong> We explain what we see and what we’d recommend in plain English. You can watch it when it fits your schedule.</li>
            <li><strong>You decide if you want to talk.</strong> If the video makes sense and you’d like to go further, we set up a call. If not, you’re done. No follow-up barrage.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>That’s it. You stay in control. We only move forward if it feels right for you.</p>

          <p>This isn’t a lead trap. It’s a way for you to understand your situation first. You tell us a bit about your business and where you’re at. We look at how you show up online and use that to give you an honest view of what’s going on and what could change. You get clarity before any commitment.
