        <div class="container">
          <span class="eyebrow">Why these numbers</span>
          <h2>Why cheaper usually doesn’t work, and when to invest more.</h2>
          <p>Like anything, you can pay for something nice or pay for it twice.</p>
          <p>Improving how you show up in Google and on the map takes a minimum amount of focused work: fixing your listing, your site, and keeping things updated. At very low monthly fees, that work often doesn’t get done in a way that actually moves the needle, so you pay but don’t see real change. On the flip side, going much higher than the ranges above is often unnecessary until you’ve seen results and want to scale. For many local businesses, a few extra good customers per month is enough for the investment to pay off. We’ll talk through your situation and give you a clear number.</p>

          <span class="eyebrow">Web Design</span>
          <h2>Need a new site or redesign?</h2>
          <p class="section-intro">If your website is slow, outdated, or unclear, it can waste the leads you’re paying for. We offer simple, conversion focused web design that makes it easy to call or request a quote.</p>
          <p><strong>Typical add on:</strong> Web Design can be bundled into any plan. We’ll quote it based on pages, content, and how much needs to be rebuilt.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Fast, mobile friendly build:</strong> Clean, fast pages that work well on phones.</li>
            <li><strong>Lead focused layout:</strong> Clear calls to action, visible phone and forms.</li>
            <li><strong>SEO friendly structure:</strong> Pages set up to support rankings and local visibility.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Ballpark (one time):</strong> Most small business sites land around <strong>$1,000 to $1,500</strong> for design and build, depending on pages and content.</p>
          <p><strong>Important:</strong> Websites need regular updates. A one time build with no ongoing work usually does more harm than good if your goal is to be found on Google.</p>

          <p class="section-intro">Traffic is worthless if visitors do not convert. Conversion Optimization focuses on turning more of your existing visitors into calls and form submissions.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Calls to action:</strong> Clearer buttons and contact paths on key pages.</li>
            <li><strong>Form improvements:</strong> Shorter, clearer forms that people actually complete.</li>
            <li><strong>Layout adjustments:</strong> Page changes that remove confusion and highlight what matters.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics and tracking:</strong> Analytics, call tracking, and conversion tracking set up so you can see what is working.</li>
          </ul>
