      <section class="section">
        <div class="container">
          <span class="eyebrow">Why these numbers</span>
          <h2>Below this range usually doesn’t move the needle. Above it is often more than you need at first.</h2>
          <p>Cheaper options tend to spread effort too thin. There’s a minimum amount of real work it takes to improve how you show up in search and in Maps. Below the ranges above, that work usually doesn’t get done in a way that moves rankings. On the other side, going much higher early on is often unnecessary until you’ve seen results and want to scale. For many local businesses, a few extra good customers per month is enough for the investment to make sense. We’re happy to talk through your numbers so you can decide what’s right for you.</p>
