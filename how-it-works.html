          <p class="section-intro">We designed this process for busy owners who don’t have time to become marketers. You stay focused on your work; we handle the visibility piece in plain English and with one clear contact: us.</p>

              </button>
              <div class="timeline-step-body">
                <p>We start with a short, plain-English conversation. You tell me what you do, where you work, your best customers, and what “busy enough” looks like for you. I’ll look up how you currently appear online while we talk so we’re working from reality, not guesswork.</p>
                <p>This isn’t a sales pitch. It’s a chance to align on your goals and your situation so the next steps make sense for you.</p>

                <p>I make sure people can actually find you: your Google listing is accurate and complete, your main pages explain what you do and where, and your contact details are easy to tap and call. Many businesses are invisible simply because the basics are wrong or missing. We fix that first.</p>

                <p>We make you look as good online as you are in real life: clear examples of your work, real photos, and simple explanations of how you work so strangers feel safe choosing you. Trust is what turns a search into a call.</p>

                <p>I keep an eye on what’s working and what’s slowing down. We have quick check-ins by text or call and adjust instead of letting things slide. Marketing isn’t set-and-forget; we stay in the loop so your visibility stays steady.</p>

          <span class="eyebrow">What you can expect</span>
          <h2>Your time, respected.</h2>
          <p>At the start, we’ll need one focused call and a few emails or texts to gather details. After that, most owners spend less than an hour a month with us—usually quick check-ins to confirm what we’re seeing and what’s coming next. You’re not handed a dashboard to learn or a long list of tasks. We do the work; you get updates in plain English when it matters.</p>
          <p>If you’re curious what we actually do in that time, our <a href="/services">services page</a> breaks down SEO, Google Ads, and website work so you can see what fits your situation.</p>
          <h3>What happens in the first call</h3>
          <p>We’ll spend 10–15 minutes on a call (or you can fill out the form and we’ll reach out). We’ll ask what you do, where you serve, and what “good” looks like for you—more calls, more form fills, a steadier calendar. We’ll also look at how you show up on Google and your website right now so we’re working from facts. By the end, you’ll have a clear picture of where you stand and what could change. There’s no obligation and no hard sell.</p>
          <h3>After we start</h3>
          <p>Once we agree on a plan, we’ll handle the setup: fixing your listing, updating your site, or turning on ads—whatever we’ve decided fits. You’ll get short, plain-English updates so you always know what’s being done and why. If something’s not working, we’ll say so and adjust. The goal isn’t to impress you with reports; it’s to make your phone and calendar feel steady so you can focus on running your business.</p>

          <h2>You don’t get an account manager. You get us.</h2>
          <p>We’re not an agency with a junior team behind the curtain. When you work with sparkSEO, you work directly with the people doing the work. You have our contact; you can text when something feels off or when you just want a quick update. No ticket system, no waiting a week for a reply. We’re a small team (a husband and wife) who want to see small businesses succeed—you can read more on our <a href="/about" style="color: var(--color-yellow);">About us</a> page.</p>
          <p>Ready to see where you stand? Book a free <a href="/#final-cta" style="color: var(--color-yellow);">visibility check</a> and we’ll walk through how you show up online today—no pressure, no commitment.</p>

          <h2>Common questions</h2>
          <p>For more answers, see our full <a href="/faq">FAQ</a>. Here are a few quick ones about how it works:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>How long until I see results?</strong> It depends where we start. Listings and ads can bring new leads in days or weeks; deeper search work can take a few months. We’ll be honest about what to expect before we begin.</li>
            <li><strong>How much of my time will this take?</strong> One focused call at the start, then usually less than an hour a month for check-ins.</li>
            <li><strong>What if I need to stop?</strong> You keep what’s been built. No long-term lock-ins—we work month-to-month after setup.</li>
