                    <p>We tune your website and local listings so Google understands what you do, where you do it, and who you serve. This includes clear pages, local signals, and ongoing adjustments as we see what people search for.</p>

                  <div>
                    <h4>What you see happen</h4>
                    <p>Over the next few months, you notice more calls from people saying “I found you on Google”, more form fills from nearby areas you actually want, and fewer days where the calendar looks empty.</p>

                  <div>
                    <h4>How it helps</h4>
                    <p>You’re not dependent on random referrals. People who have never heard of you can still find you, trust you, and book.</p>

          <h2>Visibility works best when the pieces line up.</h2>
          <p>SEO gets you found in organic search and on the map. Google Ads gets you in front of people who are searching right now. Your website turns that click into trust so they call or fill out a form instead of bouncing. We don’t push you into all three at once—we help you choose what makes sense for your budget and goals. Many businesses start with one (often fixing the basics and SEO), then add ads or a site refresh when it’s right. Our <a href="/how-it-works">How it works</a> page walks through the process; our <a href="/pricing">Pricing</a> page gives you a sense of what to expect.</p>

              <h3>Local first</h3>
              <p>Most of our clients serve a local area—plumbers, dentists, contractors, cleaners, therapists. If your customers search “your service near me,” we make sure you show up clearly and accurately.</p>

            <article class="panel">
              <h3>Plain language</h3>
              <p>We don’t hand you dashboards or jargon. You get short updates in plain English: what we did, what we’re seeing, and what we’re doing next. You stay in the loop without learning marketing.</p>

          <h2>We do the work. You get updates.</h2>
          <p>You’re not handed a list of tasks or a dashboard to learn. We handle the technical side—optimizing your listing, writing or updating pages, setting up and monitoring ads—and we report back in plain English. You’ll know what we did, what we’re seeing, and what we’re doing next. If something isn’t working, we’ll say so and adjust. Our goal is steady, predictable lead flow so you can focus on running your business. If you’re curious about the step-by-step process, see <a href="/how-it-works">How it works</a>.</p>
