              <h2>HVAC contractor, North Texas</h2>
              <p>When we started, they showed up on page 2 for their main service + city. Calls were inconsistent and they weren’t sure which marketing, if any, was working.</p>
              <ul class="proof-metrics">
                <li><strong>Google ranking</strong> — Main keyword moved from page 2 to top 3 on page 1 within 5 months.</li>
                <li><strong>Monthly leads</strong> — Form fills and calls from the website and listing increased from about 8 to 22 per month (ongoing).</li>
                <li><strong>Google Business Profile</strong> — Listing completed and optimized; visibility in local pack improved within 2 months.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="proof-note">We focused on listing cleanup, core page SEO, and simple tracking so they could see where leads were coming from.</p>

              <h2>Family dental practice, DFW area</h2>
              <p>They had a decent site but weak local visibility. New-patient calls were down and they were spending on ads without a clear picture of results.</p>
              <ul class="proof-metrics">
                <li><strong>New patient inquiries</strong> — From roughly 12 per month to 28 per month after 4 months (listing + site + targeted content).</li>
                <li><strong>Cost per lead (ads)</strong> — Reduced by about 35% after restructuring and tightening targeting; same monthly lead goal.</li>
                <li><strong>Reviews and visibility</strong> — Listing optimized and review flow improved; local map visibility increased.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="proof-note">Work included Google Business Profile optimization, website updates for key services, and managed Google Ads with weekly adjustments.</p>

              <h2>Plumbing company, North Texas</h2>
              <p>They were almost invisible for “plumber near me” and similar searches. Most work came from repeat customers and a few referrals; they wanted more steady, first-time calls.</p>
              <ul class="proof-metrics">
                <li><strong>Phone calls from search</strong> — From about 5–10 per month to 25–35 per month within 6 months.</li>
                <li><strong>First page visibility</strong> — Now ranking on page 1 for 4 of their top 5 service + location terms.</li>
                <li><strong>Conversion rate</strong> — Site updates and clear CTAs improved visit-to-call rate; they could attribute most new calls to the work we did.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="proof-note">We fixed their listing, built out service-area pages, and ran focused local search ads while organic visibility grew.</p>
