                <p>It depends on where we start. Cleaning up your listings and running focused ads can start bringing new leads within days or weeks. Deeper search improvements (SEO) can take a few months to really show up, because Google needs time to reassess your site and rankings. We’ll be honest with you about what to expect before we begin so you’re not left wondering.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>You keep what’s been built—your website, your listings, your content. Over time, if no one maintains things, results may slowly fade (especially if competitors keep working on their visibility). But you’re never stuck. We work month-to-month after setup; if life changes or the work no longer makes sense, we pause or stop without penalties or long-term contracts.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Yes. Your website, content, and accounts are yours. We’ll help set things up in a way that you can access later, even if we stop working together. We don’t hold your site or data hostage.</p>

                <p>They can, if they’re left alone. Ads work best when someone is watching them, trimming what doesn’t work, and focusing on what does. We’ll start with a budget you’re comfortable with and only increase if it’s clearly bringing real leads. You stay in control of ad spend.</p>

Here’s what we can promise: you’ll talk directly with us (no account managers), we’ll explain what we’re doing in plain language, and if it’s not working we’ll change course or stop together. We’re a small team—a husband and wife—who would rather be honest than impressive. More on our <a href="/about">About us</a> page.</p>

                <p>At the start, we’ll need one focused call and a few emails or texts to gather details. After that, most owners spend less than an hour a month with us—usually quick check-ins to confirm what we’re seeing and what’s coming next. We don’t hand you a dashboard to learn or a long list of tasks. We do the work; you get updates when it matters.</p>

                <p>We focus on local and small businesses—people who serve a defined area or a specific type of customer. If your customers search for what you do (e.g. “plumber near me,” “dentist in [town]”), we can usually help. If you need national or global reach and big brand campaigns, we’re not the right fit.

              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>It depends on your goals, your market, and which services you need (SEO, Google Ads, website work). We don’t publish a single price because every situation is different. We’ll talk through your situation and give you a clear number—no hidden fees. Ad spend is separate and fully in your control.

              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Yes. Many businesses start with fixing the basics and SEO, then add ads or a website refresh when it makes sense. We’ll help you choose what fits your budget and goals. You don’t have to do everything at once. Our <a href="/services">Services</a> page breaks down SEO, Google Ads, and website work so you can see what each one does.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>That’s okay. The free visibility check isn’t a sales call—it’s a chance to see how you show up online and what could change. If you’re not sure you need help, we’ll still give you an honest picture. You can take it from there. No pressure.</p>
